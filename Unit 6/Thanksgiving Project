'''Objective:Create a festive Thanksgiving-themed drawing using Python. Your drawing should showcase your creativity while meeting the requirements below.

Instructions:Setup:
Open CodeSkulptor3 to begin coding.
Use the simplegui library for graphical elements.
Canvas 600 width minimum and 400 height minimum
Theme:
Your drawing should be Thanksgiving-themed. Ideas include a turkey, fall leaves, pumpkins, or a harvest table.
Requirements:Your code must include the following elements:
A frame variable to create and control the canvas.
A draw_handler function to handle the drawing logic.
Use the following drawing methods:
draw_circle
draw_line
draw_polygon
draw_point
At least one function to modularize your drawing.Use conditionals, loops, or lists for dynamic or repetitive parts of your drawing (e.g., patterns or multiple objects).Enhancements:
Use color creatively to bring out the Thanksgiving theme.
Use layering to combine shapes
