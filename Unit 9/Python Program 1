def volume(radius):  
    x = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)  # this is the special way to find how big the inside of a ball is
    return x  # this gives back the answer

r = volume(5)  # we are finding the inside size of a ball that is 5 big

print(f"The volume of the sphere is {r:.2f}")  # this tells us the answer but makes it look nice
