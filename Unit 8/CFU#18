#Aarya Haque
#1/7/25
#Period 5-6
#Version 1: Write a program that adds up all of the prices in this list: [1.95, 4.5, 0.99, 5.99]

#Modify Version 1 to do the following.
#Create a blank list called prices
#Populate this list by asking the user how many prices they want to add
#Have the user enter the price of each item
#Add up and print out the total amount of everything  

#Modify Version 2 to ask the user for both prices and item names
#At the end of the program, print them out a receipt with all items, prices, and a total

#Version 1
prices = [1.95, 4.5, 0.99, 5.99]
total = 0

for price in prices:
    total += price

print("Total price:", total)

#Version 2
# Create an empty list for prices
prices = []

# Ask the user how many prices they want to add
num_prices = int(input("How many prices do you want to add? "))

# Loop to collect the prices from the user
for i in range(num_prices):
    price = float(input(f"Enter the price of item {i+1}: "))
    prices.append(price)

# Initialize total variable
total = 0

# Add up all the prices
for price in prices:
    total += price

# Print the total
print("Total price:", total)

#Version 3
# Create an empty list for item names and prices
items = []
prices = []

# Ask the user how many items they want to add
num_items = int(input("How many items do you want to add? "))

# Loop to collect item names and prices from the user
for i in range(num_items):
    item_name = input(f"Enter the name of item {i+1}: ")
    price = float(input(f"Enter the price of {item_name}: "))
    
    # Append item names and prices to the respective lists
    items.append(item_name)
    prices.append(price)

# Initialize total variable
total = 0

# Print the receipt header
print("\n--- Receipt ---")
print("{:<20} {:>10}".format("Item", "Price"))

# Loop to display each item and its price
for i in range(num_items):
    print("{:<20} ${:>9.2f}".format(items[i], prices[i]))
    total += prices[i]

# Print the total amount
print("\nTotal: ${:.2f}".format(total))
