#Create a program that asks the user for three numbers. The main program should send those three numbers as arguments to a function to calculates and prints “The sum of your three numbers is:  XXX” 
#The main program should then send those same numbers to a second function which calculates and prints “The average of your three numbers is:  XXX”
