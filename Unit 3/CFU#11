#Version 1:
#-Write a program that asks the user for the password.
#-The Password should initially be set to “simonsnyc”
#-It keeps asking them for the password until they get it correct.
#-For the incorrect password, it should say “Wrong Password!)
#-For correct password it should say “Correct! You may enter….”
#-And then it ends the program
#Version 2 : 
#Modify Version 1 so that the User gets only 3 chances.
 #HINTS:  Use a variable to keep track of the number of guesses.
#The User is stuck in the While loop as long as num_guesses < 3 and guess != PW


#Version 1
password = "simonsnyc"
userInput = input("Enter the password plesse: ")

while password != userInput :
    print("Sorry that's incorrect :(")
    userInput = input("Enter Passcode: ")

    print("Correct you may enter")
